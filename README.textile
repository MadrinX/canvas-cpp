h1. Canvas++

An implementation of the JavaScript canvas api, written in C++.

Modern browsers that support HTML5 comes with a handy element called the canvas. It provides a surface that can be drawn upon using JavaScript. Using this canvas all sorts of things can be created.

This library makes it possible to embed such a canvas into another application. This is especially useful for games that can use the canvas to draw for examples UI's.

h2. Building

The only supported platform at the moment is OS X, and you need both boost and cmake installed to be able to build the project.

To build the dependencies Skia and V8 execute the following command:
@./deps/fetch_and_build.sh@

Create a build folder, this step is optional, but it's encouraged. It makes cleaning up a lot easier, especially because cmake creates a lot of files all over the place:
@mkdir build@
@cd build@

Generate makefiles for the project:
@cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..@

Compile:
@make@

When this is done, the demo application can be located and started from the @build/bin@ directory.
@./build/bin/demo@

h2. JavaScript API

There are some differences between the HTML5 canvas api and Canvas++. Most notably is the @getContext()@ function. Instead of calling it on the canvas dom element, it's located on the window object. So we need to call @window.getContext('2d')@.

The same apply to the @width@ and @height@ attributes. Instead of being located on the dom element, they are accessed through the window object, @window.width@ and @window.height@.

h3. Window Object

Accessed through the global @window@ object.

* @getContext(<string>)@ - Returns the graphics context. The only valid context is '2d'.
* @setInterval(<function>)@ - Register a function that will be called when the canvas should repaint itself. Returns an integer identifying the callback function.
* @clearInterval(<number>)@ - Removes the callback function with the corresponding id.
* @log(<string>)@ - Output a string to the log system.
* @width@ - Attribute that stores the width of the window.
* @height@ - Attribute that stores the height of the window.
