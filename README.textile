h1. canvas-cpp

An implementation of the javascript canvas api, written in C++.

Modern browsers that support HTML5 comes with a handy element called the canvas. It provides a surface that can be drawn upon using Javascript. Using this canvas all sorts of things can be created.

This library makes it possible to embed such a canvas into another application. This is especially useful for games that can use the canvas to draw for examples UI's.

h2. Building.

The only supported platform at the moment is OS X, and you need both boost and cmake installed to
be able to build the project.

To build the dependencies Skia and V8 execute the following command:
@./deps/fetch_and_build.sh@

Create a build folder, this step is optional, but it's encouraged. It makes cleaning up a lot easier, especially because cmake creates a lot of files all over the place:
@mkdir build@
@cd build@

Generate makefiles for the project:
@cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..@

Compile:
@make@

When this is done, the demo application can be located and started from the @build/bin@ directory.
@./build/bin/demo@
